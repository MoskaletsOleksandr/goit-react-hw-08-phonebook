React Phonebook App

This is my first full-fledged React application, a phonebook app. It allows users to add, edit, and delete contacts, as well as filter and paginate through the contact list. The app utilizes Redux for state management and React Router for routing.



Features

User authentication: Users can create an account and log in to access their personal phonebook.
Contact management: Users can add new contacts, edit existing contacts, and delete contacts from their phonebook.
Filtering and pagination: The contact list can be filtered based on a search query, and pagination is implemented to display a limited number of contacts per page.
Responsive design: The app is designed to be responsive and user-friendly across different devices and screen sizes.



Technologies Used

React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Redux: State management library for managing the application state.
React Router: Library for declarative routing in React applications.
Emotion: CSS-in-JS library for styling React components.
Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
Babel: JavaScript compiler for converting modern JavaScript syntax into browser-compatible code.
Webpack: Module bundler for packaging the application's JavaScript and other assets.
ESLint: JavaScript linter for maintaining code quality and consistency.
Prettier: Code formatter for ensuring consistent code formatting.
